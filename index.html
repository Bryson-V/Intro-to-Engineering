         <br>9/2/22:  I created a project in Tinkercad.  We learned how CAD can 
         be used in order to create designs for Mechanical Engineering, along with some
         safety.  We made a practice cad from a home appliance for a competition
         that I won.<br>

        <br>  9/16/22:  We did a boat contest, that consisted of making paper boats on top of water.
        Our boat lasted the 5 minute timer, at around 60 mg of weight.  Our boat was shaped like a box, and was able to 
        hold more weight, but we chose to lessen the weight to ensure stability.
